    <b>Old Town of Tokyo</b><br>
    After a long needed rest, I spent the remaining hours of sunlight exploring
    the old town of Tokyo. Shitamachi, in Japanese. I walked away from the hotel
    towards the Tokyo Skytree before meeting new friends in Ebisu, one of
    the trendy areas of town.

    <b>Trench and Tram Bar</b><br>
    Miki invited me to go drink with their friends for the night. Nothing about
    the night was disappointing. The Trench is a cocktail bar in Ebisu with
    an incredible interior and bartender with the best mustache in Tokyo. Who
    happened to speak Portuguese. The bar is big enough for 10 people.
    The Tram Bar is a 3 floor club with absolutely stunning interiors.

    I waited for about half an hour for the metro station to open so I could go home
    and sleep for a few hours before checking-out from my hotel.
