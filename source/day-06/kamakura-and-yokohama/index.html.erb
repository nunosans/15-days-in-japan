    <b>Day out of Tokyo</b><br>
    I left my Ryokan in the morning, stored all my luggage at the staion
    lockers, and got a train to southwest coast of Japan. The plan was to
    visit Kamakura and Yokohama. I had many places I wanted to see around there
    and managed to visit a few.

    <b>Evening in Yokohama</b><br>
    After getting lost in Kamakura as the night fell, I got on the train to Yokohama.
    Outside the station area, everything was empty and quiet. It felt unusual.
    I am sure there is a lot more to see here, I might come back another day.
