    <b>Maid Cafe</b><br>
    The waitresses of a Maid Cafe, mostly teenage girls, wear cosplay dresses
    and call their customers, mostly men, “Master”. At the one I went to they
    performed a series of magic tricks, sang and danced all in style of a
    Japanese anime. While inside, they only let me take a photo of the ice cream.

    <b>Ueno</b><br>
    From Akihabara I walked north to Ueno, to visit the Ueno park and the Ueno
    Toshogu Shrine. From there I went to Ameyoko, short for “Ameya Yokocho” which
    means "Candy Store Alley".

    Several haging o-makuji. O-makuji is a a little piece of paper that tells your fortune.
    When the prediction is bad, you hang it by the shrine as a way of delaying that
    bad fortune from happening.
